      <h1>ME</h1>
        <h3>
          My Name is Matthew Raymond Peters and I am in the creative advertising
          program here at CU Boulder. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2022
          with aspirations to become a Junior Art Director at an Advertising Agency.
      <h3>
          I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area across the Golden Gate Bridge
          in Marin County. I played sports my entire life and had aspirations
          to play in the NFL and then came to realize I was not being realistic
          with myself and decided to take my talents elsewhere and become a scholar.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        In terms of my passions currently I am a music fanatic and enjoy going to concerts
        and festivals around the world with my best friends.
        <p><em>(I would love to work within advertising of music festivals)</em></p>
