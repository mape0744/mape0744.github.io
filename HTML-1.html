      <h1>ME</h1>
        <h3>
          My Name is Matthew Raymond Peters and I am in the creative advertising
          program here at CU Boulder. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2022
          with aspirations to become a Junior Art Director at an Advertising Agency.
      <h3>
          I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area across the Golden Gate Bridge
          in Marin County.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        During my free time I like to consume creative media to gather ideas for future projects.
        YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, everything has a little something that you could take away from it.
        I really like all types of stuff though, so if you have anything that fits that <a href="page4.html">let me know</a>!
        I would be more than happy to have more interesting stuff to look at.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Oh I also really like animals! I've had animals my whole life and they are just the best!
        <p><em>(I just felt that needed to be said)</em></p>
