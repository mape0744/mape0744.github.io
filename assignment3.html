    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p> French bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California
        during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture
        of San Francisco today. (The nickname remains in "Sourdough Sam", the
        mascot of the San Francisco 49ers.) Sourdough has long been associated
        with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make
        bread with commercial yeast or baking soda.[10] The "celebrated"[11]
        San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced
        sourness, and indeed the strain of Lactobacillus in sourdough starters
        is named Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis (previously Lactobacillus
        sanfranciscensis),[12] alongside the sourdough yeast Kasachstania humilis
        (previously Candida milleri) found in the same cultures</p>
