    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p> French bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California
        during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture
        of San Francisco today. (The nickname remains in "Sourdough Sam", the
        mascot of the San Francisco 49ers.) Sourdough has long been associated
        with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make
        bread with commercial yeast or baking soda.[10] The "celebrated"[11]
        San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced
        sourness, and indeed the strain of Lactobacillus in sourdough starters
        is named Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis (previously Lactobacillus
        sanfranciscensis),[12] alongside the sourdough yeast Kasachstania humilis
        (previously Candida milleri) found in the same cultures

    <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment
      (the "starter" or "leaven", also known as the "chief", "chef", "head",
      "mother" or "sponge"), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing
      a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli.[22] The
      purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the
      flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters, as
      the ratio of water to flour in the starter (hydration) varies. A starter
      may be a liquid batter or a stiff dough.[23]

    <p>
      Bakers often make loaves with fermented dough from a previous batch
      (which they call "mother dough",[note 2] "mother sponge", "chef", or
      "seed sour") rather than making a new starter every time they bake.
      The original starter culture may be many years old. Because of their
      pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, such cultures are
      stable and able to prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria.
      For this reason, sourdough products inherently keep fresh for a longer
      time than other breads, and are good at resisting spoilage and mold
      without the additives required to retard spoiling of other types of bread.
